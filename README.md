# ðŸ’» Welcome to my personal project portfolio

**Ambitious Full-Stack Developer | Computer Science Graduate | .NET & PHP Enthusiast** <br/>

**LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/jekabsilkens <br/>

I am a dedicated and driven software engineering graduate with a deep commitment to producing impactful software. 
I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world challenges in tech. Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to build 
my foundation in FinTech as a Full-Stack .NET Developer for Sapiens Software Solutions, where I contributed to 
insurance system development. My responsibilities spanned all stages of the development lifecycle - 
from planning, coding, and testing to API development, bug fixing, and documentation writing. <br/>

I have a strong problem-solving desire and genuine enthusiasm for learning and tackling new challenges. 
For me, criticism isnâ€™t daunting - itâ€™s an opportunity to learn, adapt, and become a stronger developer. 
My previous development experience has not only strengthened my technical skills but also deepened my 
understanding of delivering value to my team and the end-user through effective, scalable code. 
Iâ€™m excited to join a team that values continuous improvement, teamwork and innovative problem-solving.
